Description

BookKart is an online platform designed to make buying and selling books and stationery easy and accessible. The platform offers users the choice to purchase either first-hand or second-hand books. Additionally, it provides functionality for users to sell their books directly on the platform. Based on the book's information (e.g., condition, usage), users will be offered a price for their book, which may later be resold on the site as a second-hand book.
